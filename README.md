Features:
   1)The navigation bar remains on top even after scrolling and gets a background colour when scrolled from being transparent in the            beginning.
   2)The navigation links get sandwiched into one icon when screen size is reduced.
   3)The order of appearance of images and text is alternate when in full screen but when mobile size is reached the order changes
     and text is always above the image.
   4)The site is pretty responsive to screen size changes.
   5)Icons dissapear when screen size is reduced to allow breathing space.
   6)When hovered over navigation bar links change colour.
